# Appointmentplanner

## Aim

A project set by Codecademy as part of the full stack path. Uses Create-React-App as a base, html templates and React Router basic framework given. My job was to create all the components and connect them up, maintaining controlled inputs keeping "App" stateful & chilren stateless.
This was a good overview of how React single page apps make use of <BrowserRouter>, chance to consider Separation of Concerns, and another opportunity to use build tools.
